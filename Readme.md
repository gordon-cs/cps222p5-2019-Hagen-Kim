Grading notes:
* See comments in other files
* No pull requests.  You need to use branches and pull requests to
  coordinate your work.  Even if you do everything pair programming,
  then the request message can say it was pair programmed.  Also, when
  pair programming, take turns who types and whose account you use.
  You learn differently from the "pilot" and "navigator" roles, and you
  both should get to do both.
* I set the "execute" bit for your files to 0, since they are source code,
  not runnable files.  That's probably not something you even noticed, so
  I mostly mention it in case you wonder what changed.
* Please create a .gitignore to keep project5 and *.o out of git.
