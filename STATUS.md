We attempted all requirements.

Files data.in and test.in are tests we used to test our codes. It worked fine but after modifying Makefile and main function, some methods are giving us segmentation fault and "undefined symbols for architecture x86_64" errors. I think some of these issues are raised due to technical issues related to GitHub. Jenny was able to debug some of the erros, but the results do not necessarily look the same as it's supposed to be.

We pair programmed but also split up the work so that we will be able to notice errors more clearly.
